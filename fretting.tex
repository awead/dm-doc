% Lute fretting systems

\chapter{Lute Fretting Systems}

In the previous chapter, I set forth several different methods in which we can measure
ratios of intervals to determine the quality of their temperament.  In this chapter, I
will apply these methods to different fretting schemes and determine, from a mathematical
standpoint, what kind of tempered interval each fret represents.  In some cases, the fret
will be a pure Pythagorean interval, others will be meantone in nature, some will
approximate equal temperament, and others will be completely unique.

The majority of fretting instructions published during this time provided the player with
a practical means of setting frets and did not dwell on theory.  Almost all of the sources
have very precise rules for determining fret placement with measurement tools such as a
straight-edge and compass.  These were common tools at the time for making geometrical
divisions, and when used for calculating fret placement, could be used to divide a line
into any number of equal parts.  The remainder of the sources are less precise and
instruct the player to place the fret somewhere near another until it sounds agreeable, or
to move a fret slightly in one direction or the other without providing any exact
measurements.

What follows is a comparison of several fretting systems that appeared in lute and vihuela
treatises from the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. For those sources that have
instructions on placing frets using a compass, I have determined the exact ratio of the
interval using the arithmetic methods I outlined in the previous chapter.  The details of
the calculations can be found in the appendix at the end of this paper.

The temperaments of the intervals found in these sources vary from Pythagorean, to
meantone and equal division, to intervals that do not conform to any kind of specific
named temperament. Methods on fret placement from the first half of the sixteenth century
are almost exclusively Pythagorean in nature.  Around the middle of the century, sources
begin to introduce meantone intervals into existing Pythagorean systems.  By the end of
the sixteenth century, newer sources present systems that divide the octave into twelve
approximately equal parts, but fall short of matching modern-day equal temperament.  By
the seventeenth century, we find sources that provide instructions for equal temperament
that are the closest we have to modern-day equal temperament, yet they did not appear to
gain widespread use.

The overall picture for lute temperaments from the sixteenth through early seventeenth
centuries can be outlined as follows: Pythagorean tunings were used exclusively at the
beginning of the period, and retained some use for certain intervals later in the period.
By the mid-sixteenth century, lute players began to add different types of tempered
intervals into the existing Pythagorean scheme.  Some of these intervals were meantone,
some approximating equal temperament and others were solely original in their quality.  By
the end of century and onward, fretting systems remained either mixed or approximated
equal temperament in some way. The important distinction between these systems and other
keyboard temperaments used at the time was that lute temperaments did not fall completely
into one kind of tuning or temperament. They were very much to themselves, unlike any
other systems at the time.

\section{Pythagorean Tunings for Lute}

Starting in the 9th century, most if not all fretted instruments were tuned according to
Pythagorean ratios.  Frets on these instruments yielded pure fifths, fourths, and octaves
as well as wholetones with a ratios of 9:8. \autocite[9]{ML:1} The result of this, as we
saw in the previous chapter, was that major thirds were much wider than pure.  What we
know of the lute prior to 1500 suggests that it was a four- or five-stringed instrument
tuned in fourths.  Such a tuning would accommodate a Pythagorean tuning quite well, but by
1500 the lute's repertoire was changing and a sixth string was added.  The new tuning of
the 6-course lute created a minor third between the instrument's third and fourth courses
which would expose the major limitation of a Pythagorean system of tuning. Sources in the
early sixteenth century still advocated Pythagorean systems of tuning, but these mostly
came from theory treatises where the emphasis was on mathematical principles.

In the first quarter of the sixteenth century, the impetus for new lute tunings came from
players, not theorists.  The first books of music printed by Petrucci in the early 1500s
included polyphonic music for lute.  One of the mainstays of lute music in the sixteenth
century was intabulated polyphony, or polyphonic music arranged for the lute.  Composers
who played and composed music for the lute would include many of these intabulations in
their publications. Because this music had many harmonies that relied on thirds, a
Pythagorean system of tuning would have presented some obvious shortcomings.  It is at
this point that we see a gradual shift away from Pythagorean tunings for lute and towards
meantone temperaments.

When lutes began to incorporate thirds into the tuning of their open strings, players
began to alter the Pythagorean placement of their frets.  No doubt that they had already
been doing this before, but the notion of a third that is inherent in the tuning of the
instrument's open strings would naturally force the issue; furthermore, music during the
late fifteenth century favored thirds and sixths in polyphony, and this continued into the
sixteenth century as well. Because intabulated polyphony was one of the primary sources of
solo music for the instrument, it forced the issue that Pythagorean tuning was
insufficient to meet the needs of music at the time.

With the intabulation of Renaissance polyphonic works for lute and the appearance of a
six-course instrument at the beginning of the sixteenth century, the lute's fretting
system began a period of metamorphoses moving away from the established Pythagorean system
of tuning and into different varieties of meantone temperament.  Ultimately, lutes settled
into a type of equal temperament where the their frets stayed until the instrument's
demise some 300 years later.  The process was quite slow and at many points along the
journey, different temperaments could be in use at the same time.  However, it was because
of the difficulty the lute had in adjusting to keyboard temperaments that it constantly
felt the need to redefine its own tuning system.

During the first half of the sixteenth century, at least three different tuning methods
for lute were published.  Two of these kept with the existing Pythagorean tradition of the
day, while the third departed from that tradition and employed a kind of meantone tuning
similar to the tuning that Pietro Aaron and Vicentino were developing at the same time.
Oronce Fin\'{e} \textit{Epithoma musice instrumentalis}, published in 1530, was one of the
sources that kept with Pythagorean principles.  Fin\'{e} was a professor of mathematics at
the University of Paris and published mostly theoretical works about mathematics. It was
his personal interest in music that compelled him to write \textit{Epithoma}. Written in
Latin, the book includes instructions for tuning a lute, reading tablature and setting
frets of a lute.  Pierre Attaingnant was a friend of Fin\'{e}'s and it was mostly likely
this friendship that resulted in the treatise's publication.  An additional set of lute
instructions appear in Attaignant's publication \textit{Tres breve et familiere
introduction pour entendre et apprendre [...]} in 1529, this time written in French.  Some
stipulate that there instructions were from Fin\'{e} and just translated, but this has
never been fully proven.\autocite[1]{PV:1}

Another example of Pythagorean tuning appeared in a book published about the middle of
sixteenth-century.  The book was not about music and instead contained various topics
concerning France.  Appearing in 1556 and carrying the long title of \textit{Discours non
plus melancoliques que diverses, de choses mesmement, qui appartiennent a notre FRANCE: \&
a la fin La maniere de bien \&iustement entoucher les Lucs \& Guiternes}, it has been
attributed to Bonaventure des Periers, but some sources list it as an anonymous author.
The subject of tuning lutes and guitars appears in the last chapter of the book, which
curiously has nothing to do with any of the other chapters in the book. The final chapter
of \textit{Discours [...]} contains instructions for fretting and tuning these instruments
as well as a diagram of a mesolab, an ancient geometric tool that was first used to solve
the issue of dividing a string into equal semitones.

In his assessment of their fretting instructions, Marlk Lindley has concluded that Both
Fin\'{e} and the anonymous \textit{Discours [...]}  preserved the same characteristics of
other Pythagorean tuning methods.  These included earlier theorists from the fifteenth
century such as Henri Arnaut, Johannes Legreze, Nicola Burzio and Franchino Gafurio, as
well as more contemporary theorists like Heinrich Schreiber of Erfurt and Pietro Aron
\autocite[11]{ML:1}. The features of these fretting schemes resulted in fourths and fifths
at ratios of 4:3 and 3:2 respectively, and wholetones with a ratio of 9:8.  Semitones
depended on which fret the measurements began.  In \textit{Discours [...]}, frets 2, 4 and
6 were a series of 9:8 ratios beginning with the nut, while frets 1, 3, 5 and 7 were
series of 9:8 ratios beginning with the seventh fret and moving backwards.  Fin\'{e}'s
method was slightly different, placing frets 6, 8 and 10 at 9:8 ratios starting from the
twelfth fret.

The inherent problem with these fretting systems is that the placement is based purely on
mathematics and maintaining Pythagorean ratios without any deference to practical
musicianship. Fin\'{e} was not a musician, and Lindley suggests that that the author of
\textit{Discours [...]} was not either \autocite[11]{ML:1}.  Furthermore, after attempting
to play various pieces from the period, he concludes that ``it seems doubtful to me that
sensitive players would really have left the pythagorean scheme unaltered.''
\autocite[13]{ML:1}.  This becomes apparent in later sources from Juan Bermudo and
Sylverstro Ganassi who began with Pythagorean tuning schemes and then proceed to adjust
them to make them more palatable.

Successive instructions on fretting from the mid-sixteenth century onward de-emphasized
Pythagorean systems in favor of tempered intervals and methods of equal fretting.  While
they certainly acknowledged Pythagorean intervals, and writers such as Bermudo and Ganassi
offered complete fretting systems using Pythagorean ratios, they were never intended to be
a final solution. Most musicians recognized the importance of Pythagorean intervals, such
as the fourth, fifth, octave and in some cases the wholetone; however, they also used
non-Pythagorean intervals to compensate for their musical shortcomings.  The primary
distinction between sources that advocated Pythagorean tuning versus a tempered kind was
that Pythagorean sources tended to focus on more mathematical issues than musical ones.

\section{Gerle's fretting instructions}

The first major break with Pythagorean systems of tuning for lute came from Hans Gerle, a
lutenist and composer who published his treatise in 1533.  In addition to its specific
explanation of fret placement, it is also one of the best sources for lute instruction and
practice in the early sixteenth century.  It contains detailed explanations of tuning,
right-hand and left-hand technique as well as tablature.  The most important feature of
Gerle's treatment of lute fretting, and the others that I will be analyzing in this
chapter, is that Gerle was a lute player and not a theorist. From this viewpoint, matters
of theory are discarded in favor of practicality.  Gerle probably knew very little of the
implications of breaking with the tradition of Pythagorean tuning.  His emphasis was on
finding a practical way to fret the lute in such a way that it would sound agreeable.  The
importance of his instructions become more apparent when we see other lutenists such as
John Dowland borrowing many of Gerle's methods over 75 years later.

Gerle's instructions are directed towards a player who may or may not have theoretical
knowledge of music, but would have had some rudimentary knowledge of arithmetic and
geometry.  His process involved using a compass and a straight edge, such as a piece of
wood or other material that the player cuts to be the same length as the vibrating string
length of the instrument.  The marks were made on the straight edge using the compass to
divide the distances between each mark into different parts.  Once all the appropriate
marks were made, they could be transferred to the fretboard and the frets placed
accordingly.

He uses a very straight-forward, step-by-step approach for setting each fret, beginning
with the twelfth.
\begin{blocks}
Take a straight-edge that is thin or else a flat piece of wood like a ruler, and make it
of such a length that at the top it touches the piece of wood that the strings lie on and
also touches the bridge that the strings lie on, and when you have made the ruler so that
it touches at both ends (don't make it too short; it must touch as I have said), mark the
bottom part at the bridge with an a, and the top part with a b, so that you will know
which end belongs to the bridge.  Then lay the ruler on a table, and take a compass and
find the middle of the ruler.  Mark it with a point or little dot and put an m there.
\end{blocks}
By placing the twelfth fret in the middle of the string, he divides the string in half
yielding $ \frac{1}{2} $, or in terms of a ratio, this would be an octave of 2:1.
Compasses were widely used at this time to perform all kinds of geometrical divisions and
we can assume most learned individuals at this time would know how to use one in order to
execute Gerle's instructions.  Euclid, the Greek mathematician, described procedures for
dividing lines into equal parts in his famous work \textit{Elements}.  This book was
first translated into Latin in 1482 and appeared in English translation by 1570.  Although
Gerle was German, it is reasonable to assume that he could have had access to either a
copy in Latin or in German.  As far was we know, Gerle was not educated at a university
and might have had little or no knowledge of Latin; however, it is still reasonable to
assume that with Euclid's work in circulation, he could have come by the knowledge needed
to perform the required geometrical calculations.

% Gerle's seventh fret
Gerle continues using pure intervals for the fifth, or seventh fret:
\begin{blocks}
Then divide from the m to the b [in] three parts; and the first part from the m gives you
the seventh and lowest fret.  Mark it with a dot and put the number 7 there.
\end{blocks}
The letter b, marked in the previous step, is the end of the ruler on the side of the nut.
Gerle now switches to numbers for frets and indicates the seventh fret with the number 7.
The fret is marked at the first of the three parts starting from the twelfth fret or
middle of the string.  The resulting fret placement is one-third the length of the string,
making the vibrating length of the remaining string two-thirds. We can express this
semantically as a string divided into three parts with a vibrating length of two parts, or
3:2, which corresponds to the pure fifth.  Gerle could have divided the entire string into
three parts and place the seventh fret at the first part from the nut, but it seemed more
important to base successive frets on the location of existing ones, in this case, the
twelfth.

% Gerle's first fret
Gerle's instructions continue with the first fret, and similar to his instructions for the
seventh, he builds on the calculations of the previous fret to find this distance for this
one.
\begin{blocks}
Then divide elevenfold from the number to the b, and two of the same parts down from the b
give you the first fret.  Mark this also with a dot and put the number 1 there.
\end{blocks}
The ``number'' he is referring to is seven, or the seventh fret that we just marked in the
previous step.  Here he has us divide the distance from the nut to this fret in eleven
parts and mark the second of these parts starting from the nut. This creates a ratio of
33:31, which is not Pythagorean but instead somewhere between the diatonic semitone
16:15 and the ratio 17:16. Mark Lindley has determined that this distance is actually a
one-sixth comma semitone, but what kind?  In chapter two, we examined systems of equal
division that divided the octave into multiple parts greater than twelve.  Sixth-comma
meantone corresponded to an octave divided into 55 parts and the first fret on the lute
would be the first semitone in a 55-division system.  If the semitone is was minor or
chromatic, it has four parts, and if it is major or chromatic, it has five.

To determine which semitone Gerle was using we can compare our calculations of his fret
distance with the known values of different semitones.  If we express Gerle's 33:31 ratio
as a decimal by dividing 33 by 31, we get $ \frac{33}{31} = 1.0645 $ rounded off
to the nearest fourth decimal place.
\begin{table}[h!]
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ r l }
        Equal temperament semitone:     & $ 2^\frac{1}{12} = 1.0600 $ \\
        Sixth comma chromatic semitone: & $ 2^\frac{4}{55} = 1.0517 $ \\
        Sixth comma diatonic semitone:  & $ 2^\frac{5}{55} = 1.0650 $ \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Equal and sixth-comma semitones}
    \label{table:6semitones}
\end{table}
Comparing that value to the values of other semitones in table ~\ref{table:6semitones} we
can see that Gerle's first fret is exactly equal, by three decimal places, to a diatonic
semitone in sixth comma meantone temperament.

Gerle has departed from Pythagorean tuning and opted for a tempered semitone at the first
fret.  This is not to say that he is advocating a sixth comma meantone tuning overall.
Gerle still has us using a pure fifth at the seventh fret, which is not the same as a
fifth tuned in sixth comma.  A sixth-comma fifth is slightly flatter.
\begin{table}[h!]
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ r l l }
        Pure fifth:        & 3:2                 & $ = 1.5000 $ \\
        Sixth comma fifth: & $ 2^\frac{32}{55} $ & $ = 1.4967 $ \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Comparison of pure and sixth-comma fifths}
    \label{table:6fifths}
\end{table}
The fifth is comprised of three whole tones and one diatonic semitone. In a sixth-comma
system this makes up 32 parts or dieses, and the resulting interval is slightly smaller
than the pure Pythagorean fifth, which is what we should expect in any regular meantone
temperament (see table ~\ref{table:6fifths}). This will have implications when we examine
the internal tuning issues of lutes later.

% Gerle's second fret
After having placed the first fret, Gerle continues with the placement of the second, or the whole tone.
Here, he returns to the standard Pythagorean 9:8 ratio:
\begin{blocks}
Then divide again from the number 7 to the b threefold, and the first part down
from the b gives you the second fret.  Mark it also with a dot and put the
number 2 there.
\end{blocks}
Here we have a three part division from the seventh fret to b, which is the nut.
By returning to our earlier calculation of the seventh fret, we can formulate the
second fret distance and vibrating length accordingly which results in the Pythagorean
wholetone.

% Gerle's fifth fret
So far, Gerle has mixed Pythagorean pure intervals with tempered ones, such as
the fifth, the major second and the tempered minor second.  As he moves to the
perfect fourth at the fifth fret, he writes:
\begin{blocks}
Then divide from the m to the b in two parts, and the one part gives you the
fifth fret. Mark it with a dot and put the number 5 there. Starting from the
twelfth fret, Gerle divides the distance into two parts and takes the first part
from the nut as the mark for the fret.
\end{blocks}
The letter m is our octave fret, the exact midpoint of the string. Since
he is now dividing that again in half, this produces a
Pythagorean interval of the fourth with a ratio of 4:3.

% Gerle's sixth fret
Now Gerle turns his attention to the tritone, or sixth fret, where he uses the
arithmetic mean, as opposed to the geometric mean, between the fifth and seventh
frets.
\begin{blocks}
Then put the sixth fret in the middle of the fifth and seventh frets.  Make it
with a dot and put the number 6 there.
\end{blocks}
Doing so places the fret in the middle distance between the two.
The resulting calculation yields a fret and vibrating ratio of
24:17.

Gerl's tritone is neither Pythagorean ratio nor sixth-comma
meantone, but it may be close enough to be considered equally tempered.
In a sixth comma
meantone with a 55-division octave, the trione contains either 27 or 28 dieses depending on
whether or not the semitone above the fourth is chromatic or diatonic.  For a lute
tuned in G, this would be the difference between a D-sharp and an E-flat.
Calculating the decimal equivalents for these two semitones shows us that Gerle's tritone
falls somehwere in between the chromatic and diatonic
semitones.  Although numerically this fret is not identical to the equally-tempered
tritone, if we look at a scaled
drawing depicting the location the fret in relation to the other types of intervals,
Gerle's fret and the location of the equally-tempered fret look nearly identical.
We must note that Gerle places the fret in the middle of the other two frets without
the use of a compass.  Furthermore, while Gerle's sixth fret may come close enough
to equal temperament that we could
call it an equally tempered interval, he is not using equal temperament in the modern
sense.  In fact, Gerle was using meantone in its original sense, the way in which
Aaron would have tuned.

Meantone temperaments that did not use equal division create some of the semitones by dividing
the wholetone into two geometrically equal halves. The
resulting semitone was simply the mean, or average, of the tone, which is where the term
meantone originates.  Aaron's original instructions did not consider every semitone in the scale,
it only covered a set of thirds that were tuned pure.  Semitones that were not inlcuded in the
scheme were simply divded in half, spliting a wholetone into two relatively equal parts.
So we must take into account that the
calculation of this fret is an approximation and discount the use of
arithmetic to prove what kind of semitone Gerle was trying to specify between
the fifth and seventh frets.  If we look at a scaled drawing comparing the
placement of the different semitones, Gerle's fret favors the chromatic side
slightly, although given the difference shown in the drawing, it is for all
practical purposes the same as an equally tempered semitone.
% Diagram of Gerle's 6th fret
\input{figures/gerle-6}

% Gerle's third fret
Gerle next instructs us to place the third fret using a new technique whereby he
takes the portion of one fret and uses it to compute the distance of another.
In this case, he takes a portion of the distance from the nut to the first fret
and uses it to find the third.
\begin{blocks}
Then divide from the number 1 to the b [in] three parts, and when you have the
three parts then go with the compass unaltered down from the number 1 again five
spans; that gives you the third fret.  Mark it with a dot and put the number 3
there.
\end{blocks}
Assuming that the span is one part of the three parts into which the first fret
distance is divided, the total spans from the nut (b) is eight: the five spans
from the first fret to the third, plus the original three spans from the nut to
the first fret.  The resulting 99:83 ratio is closest to a diatonic sixth comma
meantone minor third.  In looking at the scale drawing, Gerle's third fret is
almost exactly in the same place at the diatonic sixth comma one, both of which
are slightly sharper than the equally tempered one.
% Diagram of Gerle's third fret
\input{figures/gerle-3}

% Gerle's fourth fret
The last fret is the fourth which makes the major
third.  Similar to the sixth fret, he averages the distance between the third
and fifth.
\begin{blocks}
Then put the fourth fret between the third and the fifth frets.  Mark it with a
dot and put the number 4 there.
\end{blocks}
Averaging the distance between the two frets results in the ratio 792:629.

% Diagram of Gerle's fourth fret
\input{figures/gerle-4}
Since this is not a Pythagorean ratio, the closest this interval comes to is
actually the equal tempered major third. Although Gerle is using the same meantone
technique that he used to place the sixth fret, this fret could technically be
considered a meantone third. If we look at another scaled drawing, Gerle's
major third is a little narrower than a true equally tempered third, and wider than a major third
in a sixth comma temperament.  On a lute with a mensur length of 70 centimeters,
the difference in actual distance between Gerle's major third and a sixth comma
meantone major third is about 2 millimeters.  The difference between Gerle's
third and a quarter comma meantone third is 4 millimeters.  So when speaking of
comparisons that account for a few thousandths of a decimal, the numbers
themselves are small, but when translated into a real instrument, the
differences become large.

Gerle limits his fret placement calculations to the seventh fret only; however,
he does provide instructions for placing an eighth but without leaving us any
geometrical calculations to do so.
\begin{blocks}
But if on the lute one wants eight frets, then let him make the eighth fret a
little closer to the seventh fret than the sixth is.
\end{blocks}
Taken at face value, we cannot really determine what Gerle exactly means other
than the semitone between seventh and eighth fret is smaller than the semitone
between the sixth and seventh.  At this point, we are to assume that the player
may use his or her ear to adjust the fret accordingly.  This same rule would
hold true for the rest of the frets as well.

\section{John Dowland's fretting instructions}

Another set of fretting instructions that came much later after Gerle, but are closely
related to his in method were a set of frettings from the English lutenist John Dowland.
Dowland was one of the best known lutenists of his day and his importance
as a composer of songs and solo music for the lute continues to this day.
He published five books for lute and voice, as well as music for viol consort
and lute accompaniment.  His solo works existed mostly in manuscript, with the
notable exception the \textit{Varietie of Lute-Lessons} which was published
by his son, Robert Dowland, in 1610 and contained music by John Dowland and
some of his contemparies.

As the title suggests, the textit{Varietie} was intended as a
kind instruction book, although the pieces within it required a virtuosic level
of ability.  The book begins with two prefaces, one written by John Baptiste Besard
entitled \textit{Necessarie Observations Belonging to the Lute and Lute-playing}.
Besard's instructions appeared several times throughout this period \textcolor{red}{[need dates on Besard's instructions]}
and were reprinted again here.  The second preface was by John Dowland entitled
\textit{ Other Necessary Observations belonging to the Lute} where he offers additional
advice on choosing lute strings as well as setting the frets on the instrument.

Dowland's instructions follow Gerle's very closely, and at times are exactly alike.
While the two publications were more that 70 years apart, it
is obvious that Dowland must have known of Gerle's book or possibly a similar
source on the geometry of monochords that Gerle had consulted.

After giving the usual historical account of Pythagoras discovering harmony by
listening to the hammers of blacksmiths, Dowland instructs us to procure a piece
of 'whitish' wood that is just as long as the distance from the inward
side of the nut to the inward side of the bridge on the lute.  From there, his
fretting instructions are exactly the same as Gerle's with the exception that
Dowland specifies letters instead of numbers since he was using the French style
tablature system.

If we account for several printing
errors that appear in Dowland's instructions, they read very
straightforward.
\begin{blocks}
Wherefore take a thinne flat ruler of whitish woode, and make it just as long
and straight as from the inward side of the Nut to the inward side of the
Bridge, then note that wnd which you meane to the Bridge with some small marke,
and the other end with the letter A, because you may know which belongeth to the
one and to the other. then lay the ruler upon a Table, and take a payre of
compasses and seeke out the just middle of the Ruler: that note with a pricke,
and set the letter N. upon it, which is a Diapason from the A. as appeareth by
the striking of the string open.
\end{blocks}
After describing the same manner of using a ruler in place of the mensur length
of the string, Dowland places the twelfth fret, fret N, at the midpoint of the
string creating a pure 2:1 octave.
\begin{blocks}
Secondly, part the distances from N. to D. in three parts, then the first part
gives you the seaventh fret from the Nut, making a Diapente: in that place also
set a pricke, and upon it the letter H.
\end{blocks}
Dowland makes the first of many typographical errors and uses the letter D
instead of A. If we allow for that mistake and read the passage 'N. to
A.' and not 'N. to D.', it is obvious that Dowland is marking a
perfect 3:2 fifth at the letter H.  When he sets the first and
second frets, he repeates Gerle's measurements almost verbatim,
yielding a 33:31 diatonic sixth-comma semitone and a 9:8 Pythagorean wholetone.
\begin{blocks}
Thirdly, devide the distance from the letter H. to the letter A. in eleaven
parts: two of which parts from A. gives the first fret, note that with a pricke,
and set the letter B. thereon, which maketh a Semintone.  Fourthly, divide the
distance from H. to the letter A. in three parts, one of which parts from A.
upward sheweth the second fret, note that with a pricke, and set the letter D.
upon it, which maketh a whole Tone from A.
\end{blocks}
When he gets to the fifth fret there is another typo, mistakenly indicating the
first fret instead of the fifth, but otherwise the same 4:3 pure fourth that
Gerle uses.
\begin{blocks}
Fifthly, divide the distance from N. to A. into two parts, there the first part
sheweth you the first [ie. fifth and not first] fret, sounding a Diastessaron:
in that place also set a pricke, and upon it the letter F.
\end{blocks}
The sixth fret proceeds the same a Gerle's as the average between the fifth and
seventh, giving us the same ratio of 24:17.
\begin{blocks}
The sixt fret with is a G. must be place just in the middle betwixt F. and H.
which maketh a Semidiapente.
\end{blocks}

When Dowland reaches the third fret, he departs from Gerle's
geometrical instructions:
\begin{blocks}
Seventhly, divide the distance from the letter B. to A. in three parts, which
being done, measure from the B. upwards foure times and a halfe, and that wil
give you the third fret, sounding a Semiditone: mark that also with a prick,
\& set thereon the letter D.
\end{blocks}
Whereas Gerle would measure five of his spans from the first fret, Dowland only
uses four and a half. This results in a ratio of 198:168 which is approximately
the same as the sixth comma chromatic semitone.

\input{figures/dowland-3}

The process which Dowland uses for his third fret is very odd.
Until now, whole numbers are used when making geometical divisions with a compass.
If we wanted to be exact as possible, we could find the
mean of the original span that is used to find the distance to the
third fret and have a true “four and a half spans,” but Dowland does not instruct
us to do that.

There are serveral possible explanations for Dowland's odd calculation.  First, Dowland could have
been leaving the
method of calculation to the player.  Someone who was able enough
to execute Dowland's geometrical calculations would have been able to find
the exact number of spans necessary, if he or she was willing to be that exact.  Perhaps
Dowland simply did not want to go into the extra details.
A second explanation is that Dowland knew he preferred a chromatic semitone and used the specification of 4.5 spans as an
approximation.  The compelling case for this explanation is that the 4.5 span
measurement is so close to a chromatic semitone in sixth comma meantone, the
same kind of regular meantone temperament that Gerle was using. A third explanation
is that Dowland did not know he was expressing the difference between the chromatic and diatonic
semitone and arrived at the interval ``by ear.''  Either by experimentation or estimation, he found a way to mathematically
represent the fret placement with an approximate measure of
4.5 spans.

% Dowland's fourth fret
As Dowland moves on the fourth fret, he places it using the same arimetic
mean that Gerle used in his instructions.
\begin{blocks}
then set the fourth fret just in the middle, the which wil[l] be a perfect
\emph{ditone}:
\end{blocks}
Since Dowland's third fret was slightly smaller than Gerle's, this will make
the placement of his fourth fret different from Gerle's as well, coming to
a ratio of 1584:1266 which is very close to a quarter-comma chromatic
semitone.
\input{figures/dowland-4}
Although this could lend support to an argument in support of quarter-comma meantone
on fretted instruments, it is the only interval in
this scale that appears to be tempered this way.  The other intervals are still
a mix of Pythagorean and sixth-comma meantone intervals.

% Dowland's other frets
Dowland goes on to give us instructions for placing the eighth, ninth and tenth
frets instead of stopping at the seventh as Gerle does; however, it is at this
point that his calculations go awry.  He places the remaining
three frets using the same process:
\begin{blocks}
then take one third part from B. to the Bridge, and that third part from B.
maketh I. which soundeth \emph{Semitonium cum Diapente}, then take a third part
from the Bridge to C. [N.B. He means C. to the Bridge and not the other way
around] and that third part maketh E. [N.B. Another misprint here, he means the
ninth fret, K.] which soundeth \emph{Tonus cum diapente}, or an
\emph{Hexachordio maior}.  Then take one third part from D. to the Bridge, and
that third part from D. maketh L.  which soundeth \emph{Ditonus cum Diapente}.
\end{blocks}
Apart from the errors with the ninth fret, Dowland is repeating the same pattern
for each remaining fret.  He seems to be calculating these frets placements by
dividing the total distance between one fret and the bridge into three parts and
then setting the fret one-third the distance from that fret.  In looking at the
mathematical result of this process, we find the ratios of the higher frets
are actually decreasing when they should be increasing.  Either we are misinterpreting Dowland's
instructions because of further errors in the printed source, or Dowland has
simply got his calculations wrong.

\begin{table}[h!]
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ r l l }
        99:68 ratio   & $ \frac{99}{68}   $ &  = 1.4559 \\
        27:19 ratio   & $ \frac{27}{19}   $ &  = 1.4210 \\
        594:426 ratio & $ \frac{594}{426} $ &  = 1.3944 \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Decimal ratios of Dowland's eighth, ninth and tenth frets}
\end{table}

If we return to the calculations that we obtained following Gerle's scheme, the
only differences between those and Dowland's are the third and fourth fret.
However, in looking at the semantic instructions themselves the real difference
lies with the third fret.  Gerle required 5 spans from the first to the third
fret while Dowland required slightly less, 4.5.  The semantic instructions for
the fourth fret were the same in both sources: place the fourth fret in the
middle, between the other two.  The ratio of the fourth fret was only different
because the third fret was, having been shorted slightly.  If we then entertain
the possibility that Dowland was essentially using Gerle's original instructions
directly, but with only a slight modification to the third fret, perhaps due to
personal preference, we could then see that the eighth, ninth and tenth frets
were of Dowland's own doing.

The last three frets of Dowland's scheme had no precedent, if we assume that
Dowland was using Gerle as his primary source.  Dowland then was on his own to
determine in a proper procedure for obtaining the right proportional distance
for those last frets.  Due to the calculations above, it is clear that one
cannot arrive at a useable placement for the last three frets of his scheme.
Nor can one use Dowland's own fretting instructions as complete source because
there is no mention of the eleventh and twelfth frets which figure prominently
in his music, and especially the contents of the book which his instructions
preface.

\section{Ganassi's \textit{Regola Rubertina}}

Because Dowland and Gerle hold many similarities in their fretting instructions, we can make
a strong case to use them as a single unit for comparison, since all but one of their frets
align very closely.  An important source that would contrast with their methods is Silvestro Ganassi's
instruction method for viola da gamba entitled, \textit{Regola Rubertina}.
Although he was a gamba player and his method is intended for
that instrument and not a lute, it does contain fretting instructions that are valueable
when applied to the lute

Ganassi approches his subject slightly differently than Gerle and Dowland.  In the fourth chapter
of his treatise, he specifies the locations of each fret using a compass and string division,
just as Gerle and Dowland do; however, in the fifth chapter, he adjusts some of these frets to different
positions by comparing unisions from one string on the instrument to another.  The first, second,
third, sixth and eight frets are adjusted flatter than their initial placements, while the fourth
fret is adjusted sharper.  Some of these changes are markedly different than in other treatieses
of the time, namely the fourth fret.  Although, the frets that make the wholetone, fourth
and fifth, are all kept to their Pythagorean ratios.

For example, Ganassi opens his fourth chapter with the second fret, and uses the same
Pythagorean wholetone ratio that everyone else has used at this time:

\begin{blocks}
Please note that the proportion \emph{sesquioctava} produces pitches expressed
by these two number, 9:8.  This proportion determines the location of the second
fret.  If you divide the string, beginning from the nut on the fingerboard and
ending at the bridge, where the bow is drawn, into nine parts, the first of the
nine parts sets the boundary of the second fret.
\end{blocks}

He also uses the pure 4:3 ratio of the
perfect fourth because he says the open strings that are played against it must
be in unison.

\begin{blocks}
Then, you divide the string into four parts; the first of these four part will
set the location fo the fifth fret, which produces the consonance of a fourth,
which is created by the proportion of sesquitertia indicated by a ratio of 4:3
[ \ldots ] This produces the consonance of the prefect fourth, because if
one then plays the open string, which is at the end of the fourth part of the
string length, one achieves the opposite of the 4:3 ratio
\end{blocks}

Most players would have tuned their open strings using the the fifth fret of the
adjacent string.  In this case, Ganassi is merely underscoring the fact that the
fifth fret should be at a the ratio of a pure fourth because the interval of a fourth
between the adjacent strings of the viol should be pure as well.

Lastly, the seventh fret is kept to a pure ratio as well:

\begin{blocks}
Then you divide the string length into three parts. The first of the three parts will be the
end of the seventh fret, thereby producing the consonance of the perfect fifth, of \textit{diapente},
which is formed with the proportion of \textit{sesquialtera} indicated by the ratio of 3:2.
\end{blocks}

So for these frets, Ganassi is reiterating what most other theorists belived about tuning
the wholetone, fourth and fifth by maintaining their Pythagorean ratios.
In chapter five, ``Method of Adjusting the
Frets,'' Ganassi verifies the positions of these three frets by checking the unisons against
the various open strings of the instrument.  All this is to reify that he
wants the all the intervals between open strings to be pure Pythagorean ratios.  It is important
to note here that this precludes the use of any meantone temperament since the fifths would need
to be tempered flatter than pure.  We may also say the same thing about Dowland and Gerle's
methods since their fourths and fifths are pure as well.

Once Ganassi has completed setting those frets, he does not revisit them.  However, this is not the case
for the other frets of the instrument.  It is the other intervals that
distinguish Ganassi's ideas about fret placement from some his contemporaries.  For one, he
departs from certain meantone and Pythagorean ratios in favor of his own that are produced by
comparing tones from one string and fret, to the tones of a different string or fret.

\subsection{Ganassi's non-Pythagorean frets}

Ganassi's first fret differs in size from both Gerle and Dowland.  He begins by
having us place the first fret in a Pythagorean ratio, but eventually moves it to
a different kind of ratio.  In chapter four, he writes:

\begin{blocks}
After you have positioned the second fret in the manner described above, the
first fret should be set half way between the major and minor semi-tones by
their respective proportions.  In order not to go into this at length, however,
I believe that I have chosen a similar method for finding the first fret which
produces a minor semitone, quite easily.\autocite[106]{RB:2}
\end{blocks}

Mark Lindley's translation of this this passage is slightly different:

\begin{blocks}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r l}
Dapoi che hauerai touato \&            & Now when you have found and \\
terminato il ditto sec\={o}do tasto    & located the second fret \\
c\={o} il modo ditto di sopra          & by the method given above, \\
il tasto primo sera terminato al meza  & the first fret is located halfway  \\
tra il scagneleto del manico al        & between the nut and the  \\
secondo tasto ma de piu zoe            & second fret, but more, i.e.  \\
batt\={e}do di fora la mita della      & down the neck by half the \\
grosseza del tasto . . . \& in questo  & fret's width.  In this regard \\
ti haueria possuto resonar il          & I could have calculated for you the \\
partimento del semiton maior al minor  & division of the major and minor semitones. \\
. . . il primo tasto elqual fa leffeto & The first fret gives the effect \\
del semiton minor . . .                & of the minor semitone. \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{blocks}

Taking both translations into account, the placement of
the first fret appears to be halfway between the \textit{scagneleto del manico} or nut and the
second fret.  When the Pythagorean wholetone (9:8) is divided in half, the resulting ratio is
18:17, or what is the closest to an equal semitone.  It is not exactly the same
as a true equally tempered semitone, but is close enough that many theorists and
\begin{table}[h!]
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ r l l }
        18:17 semitone:             & $ \frac{18}{17}  $ & = 1.0588 \\
        Equal temperament semitone: & $ 2^\frac{1}{12} $ & = 1.0595 \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Comparison of the 18:17 and equally tempered semitones}
\end{table}
players advocated using a system of semitones solely based on a series of 18:17
divisions.

In the sixth chapter, Ganassi revisits the first fret and adjusts
its position so that the unison formed between the first fret on the fourth string and the fifth fret
of the fifth string of the instrument is in tune.\autocite[67]{RB:3}  Because this unison will not be
in tune if the first fret is a 18:17 ratio, the fret must be moved towards the nut slightly, flattening
it slightly.

The decimal equivilant of Ganassi's new adjusted first fret is found in a chart of frets and
their placement from Richard Bodig's article on Ganassi's \textit{Regola}.  He calculates the
changes in fret placement based on Ganassi's instructions to move frets until they are in tune
with each other.  The assumption here is that if the player is able to hear a tune unison and
move the fret to just the right place, these decimal values will result.  If we are able to
accept this assumption, Bodig's calculations represent, in an ideal way, what the exact
placement of the fret might be.

Using Bodig's calculations of Ganassi's fret adjustments, and comparing them to the fret
placements we have see thus far with Gerle and Dowland, Ganassi's first fret is much flatter
than either Dowland or Gerle.  Curiously, Ganassi's adjusted first fret is almost exactly
the same as the chromatic sixth-comma semitone.  This differs from Dowland and Gerle whose
first frets come to match the diatonic sixth-comma semitone.  For a lute tuned in G,
this would be the difference between a G-sharp and an A-flat on the first string.

% Ganassi's 1st fret
\input{figures/ganassi-1}

Ganassi's third fret undergoes a similar transformation.  In the fourth chapter, he sets the
the fret at as pure 6:5 minor third.  However, in the sixth chapter he proceeds to adjust the third fret
by tuning it to the ocatve that is formed between the first fret of the forth string and the
third fret of the first or lowest string on the instrument.  Returning to Bodig's calculations,
we can see that this results in lowering Ganassi's third fret from its intial pure minor third
to something that is flatter than an equally tempered minor third, and nothing close to either
Dowland's or Gerle's minor thirds, or any kind of sixth-comma meantone temperament.

% Ganassi's 1st fret
\input{figures/ganassi-3}

Ganassi's initial setting of the fourth fret is in the middle between the third and
fifth frets, before the third is adjusted.  This gives us a very strange ratio of 48:38.  Later,
he adjusts the position of the
fret so the octave between the second fret of the sixth string and the fourth fret of the
fourth string are in tune.  The final position of his fourth fret is one that would almost
seem unplayable since it is yielding a major third that is even sharper that equal temperament.

% Ganassi's initial fourth fret
\input{figures/ganassi-4}

The sixth and eighth frets are the only remaining frets that Gannassi places on the instrument.
Like his contemporaries, he does not provide any information about frets beyond the eighth.
His initial placement for these two remaining frets is similar to the previous one.  His
sixth is also the same as Gerle's, the arithmetic mean of the distance between the fifth
and seventh, or a ratio of 24:17.  The eight fret, which is the most
specific we have seen in any source thus far, results in a 8:5 ratio.

\begin{blocks}
Then the sixth fret is set at the midpoint of the space
between the fifth and seventh frets but somewhat less, that is so that the
thickness of the fret is within the compass of the distance; that will set its
position.  The eighth fret will be located so as to have the same spacing as the
form the fifth to the sixth frets.
\end{blocks}

His mention of the thickness of the fret is intriguing.  No other source seems to mention
this fact, that the thickness of the gut string used as the fret itself would have some
impact on its placement.  Most modern lute players use gut strings that are only
fractions of a milimeter thick for higher frets, and even the lowest fret which is generally
the thickest, might not be much thicker than a single milimeter.  No information exists
about the specific thicknesses of the gut strings used for frets on instruments during this
time.  Ganassi's mention of it here at least indicates that it may have been an issue.  His
instruction is to simply ensure that the entire thickness of the fret is within the span of the
compass.  Although, even if it were not, the effect that it would have on the resulting pitch
would be almost imperceptible.

The final adjustments to Ganassi's fretting scheme include the sixth and eighth frets, which are
moved slightly flatter than where they were originally placed during chapter four.
The unison between the sixth fret of the third string
and the first fret of the second is used to adjust the sixth fret as needed to make that sound
in tune.  The eighth fret is then adjusted so that the octave formed between the open fourth
string and the eighth fret of the third string is in tune.  Using Richard Bodig's measurements,
we can see that the final placement of the sixth
fret moves it just slightly past the mark for the chromatic sixth-comma semitone, or C-sharp on
an instrument tuned to a relative pitch of G.  It is hard to say whether this was intentional,
or simply a coincidence of Ganassi's adjustment procedures.  This is perhaps move evident in the
final placement of the eighth fret which is moved into a position that is not near any one
particular temperament, making it unique.

% Ganassi's 6th fret
\input{figures/ganassi-6}

% Ganassi's 8th fret
\input{figures/ganassi-8}

Even though Ganassi spends an entire chapter of this treatise on placing the
frets according to geometrical calculations, it is not until the sixth
chapter that we see the complete picture of his scheme.  Dividing the process
such as he does seems to acknowledge the dichotomy between a
theoretical system of string division and a practical one that works for music in the
realm of performance.  Beyond this Platonic differentiation in tuning, we really cannot know
what Ganassi's motivations are.

Ganassi holds many similarities with other sources.  The second, fifth and
seventh frets are the same as Gerle and Dowland.  His first fret, however, is noticeably
flatter than the Gerle/Dowland model, making it closer to a sixth-comma meantone
chromatic semitone instead of a diatonic one which Gerle and Dowland favor. Perhaps
the most important feature that Ganassi's fretting scheme shares with others from this period
is that combines different types of
semitones from different temperaments.  This further indicates that lute temperaments were treated
differently than temperaments for other instruments.


\section{Spanish Vihuela Sources}

Sources in published regarding the Spanish vihuela are also a significant source of information
on lute fretting.  While the instruments were different, each knew of the other's existence,
such as Miguel Fuenllana's discussion of the right-handed "foreign style" of playing in his
treatise, which refers to the thumb and index alternation of playing practiced by lutenists
at the time.

In terms of fretting, there are two vihuela sources that offer evidence of a variety of
different schemes that were used. One of the
earliest of these comes from Luis Milan, a well-known vihuela composer and poet who seems
to have spent most of his
active life around Valencia.  Although his birth dates and death dates are not known, it
is believed he died some time after 1561 due to a refence in one of the composer's books of
poetry, \textit{El Cortesano}.\autocite[6]{LG:1}  Milan is best described as a poet-bard who would compose
music and poety that we would sing or recite to his own playing.  He was active mostly a the
court of Valencia where he made his living working for the Dukes of Calabria.
His only musical publication, \textit{El Maestro}, was one of the most important vihuela
publications of the time, not only for its musical content but for its information about
performance practice.  It contains detailed information on tempo and other interpretive
elements of this music that is lacking from many other treasies of the time.

\textit{El Maestro} contains only a few references to fret placement, but they are nontheless
significiant.  Milan's own remarks were not as exact as the others we have seen.  He gave us no
measurements with which to mark frets on a straight edge, but he did give us some clues as to
which frets he wanted adjusted to acheive a
different quality for certain notes.  In Gasser's monograph on performance practices in
Milan's music, he translates the following section from \textit{El Maeastro} where
Milan discusses changing the position of the fourth fret before the music for Fantasia 14.

\begin{blocks}
Whenever you play the fourth and third tones in those places through which the fantasia moves,
raise the fourth fret of the vihuela a little, so that the note of the fret becomes strong
and not weak.

[ Siempre que ta\~{n}erais el cuatro y tercero tono por estos t\`{e}rminos que est fantas\`{i}a
anda, alzar\`{e}is un poco el cuarto traste de la vihuela para que el punto del dicho traste
sea fuerte y no flaco ]\autocite[156]{LG:1}
\end{blocks}

Additionally, there is another piece of information concerning the same fret before the
beginning of the music for \textit{Con pavor record\'{o} el moro}.

\begin{blocks}
Playing in these pieces on the vihuela, you have to raise the fourth fret a bit toward the pegs.

[ Ta\~{n}do por estas partes en la vihuela hab\'{e}is de alzar un poco el cuarto traste hacia las
clavijas de la vihuela ]\autocite[156]{LG:1}
\end{blocks}

Both references concern the fourth fret, and both offer an adjustment that raises the fret closer
to the pegs, making the interval smaller.  This would equate to a narrower major third; however,
it also assumes that the fret as been placed in some manner prior to being moved.  It is not
possible to know by what means Milan would have placed his initial fourth fret, but it seems
that for certain pieces, he preferred it to be slightly flatter.  This could corroborate
Dowland's use of a quarter-comma chromatic semitone for his fourth fret, which is substantially
flatter than either an equally-tempered or Pythagorean semitone.  However, the problem here
is that Dowland achieves a flatter fourth fret by also making his third fret flat as well.  Milan
mentions no other fret to adjust, so we might assume that all his frets were placed according
to standard Pythagorean proportions.  Still, both Dowland and Milan
do show a preference for flatter fourth frets.

Perhaps the most complete discussion on vihuela fretting appears in Juan Bermudo's \textit{De ta\~{n}er vihuela},
published in 1555.  Bermudo's publication is one of the most extensive on vihuela performance practice,
including several chapters on intabulation for the vihuela, and fret placement.  Bermudo provides a
total of three different fretting schemes.  The first of these, which appears in chapter
77, is Pythagorean.  The second scheme attempts to correct the semitones in the first
scheme by adjusting the first, sixth and eighth frets while leaving the others in their
original Phythagorean form.  The third and last of Bermudo's schemes is unrelated to either
of the previous two and is the closest to modern-day equal temperament.

Dawn Espinosa has translated Bermudo's work in great detail, with the original Spanish printed alongside
the English translation, and also includes a brief but informative discussion.  She has made
the necessary calculations in each of Bermudo's schemes and found the ratios for each.
For my analysis, I have used her calculations to compare each of Bermudo's fretting schemes
with the others that we have seen so far.

Like Ganassi, Bermudo also provides us with multiple fretting systems, one that is the traditional
Pythagorean system, and others that modify it or depart from it entirely.  This fact
may underscore the changes in fretting techniques that were occuring during the time.  Just as
Ganassi first presents us with a Pythagrean scheme, Bermudo also gives us the Pythagorean scheme
as his first fretting system.  Then, just as Ganassi spends an additional chapter correcting
the faults that are found in it, Bermudo also "corrects" the issues that one has when using
a Pythagorean system.

Bermudo refers to the "faults" found in fretting systems between notes that are \textit{mi} or
\textit{fa}.  In terms of sixteenth-century theory, this was the modern-day
equivilent of a sharp note versus a flat note.  After setting the frets in his first scheme,
the Pythagorean one, he discusses the problems found on the eighth fret:
\begin{blocks}
On the eighth fret there seem to be three faults.  This fret should be \text{fa} for the
seventh, fourth and first strings, but is it [made] \text{mi} for all the strings.
\autocite[95]{DE:1}
\end{blocks}
Bermudo is highlighting the central problem with fretting instruments, the distance of one
semitone on one string is the same for all the other semitones on that string.  Depending
on the temperament and semitone, a minor semitone might be required for one string while
a major semitone would be needed for another.

One solution to this problem that Bermudo references, and that we also see with Milan, is
that frets are moved depending on the key of the peice.  Milan mentions adjusting the
fourth fret when playing the third and fourth tones.  Bermudo mentions players who move their
frets according to their ears:
\begin{blocks}
We have seen players who, with their frets set for the sixth, want to play the fourth mode,
but are unable to do it without moving the frets as their good ear tells them.  What I intend
to do here is to give the measurements by which to place the frets, so that those who are not
[such good] musicians will be able to place them with ease and exactiude, and thus the vihuela
with be more prefect.
\autocite[78]{DE:1}
\end{blocks}
Bermudo seems to suggest here that it is the good players that are able to move their frets
for different modes, while inexperienced or lesser skilled players are unable and should
rely on Bermudo's calculations to place the frets for them.

For those players that are unable to correctly place their frets by ear, Bermudo's ultimate
solution is equal temperament.  His third scheme comes very close to this, although the composer
himself acknowledges that it is not his aim to do.  For Bermudo,
the issue was a question of theory versus practice.  Espinosa summarizes this issue succinctly
when she says of Bermudo's that, ``for him, theory has more authority than practice, but he
concedes that practice preceeds theory.'' \autocite[xx]{DE:1}  Bermudo himself says of the subject of his third
fretting scheme:

\begin{blocks}
All the [theorists] agree that the whole tone cannot be divided into two equal semitones, but
that is what we are presuming to do.  The above being the most agreed and true thing among
theorists, on the vihuela we find the opposite in practice. \autocite[xx]{DE:1}
\end{blocks}

When we examine the details of the Bermudo's third scheme, we do find that this is case. All
but two of this frets are within a few milimeters of an equally-tempered semitone. The only
exceptions here at the third and eighth frets with are slightly sharper than equal temperament.

\section{Sources of Equal Fretting}

The last category of fetting systems that we will examine, are those systems that advocated
dividing the octave into equal semitones during this time period.  This is not to say that these
systems proposed equal temperament.  True
equal temperament required logirithmic calculations and did not appear until later during the
seventeenth century.  Furthermore, as Ross Dufin has argued, equal temperament did not become
as widespread a temperament until the twentieth century, and that even during the nineteenth
century, musicians still tempered their fifths slightly more that a true equal temperament would
dictate.

Sources during this time advocated several different systems of measurement that produced
temperaments that were very close modern-day equal temperament, but achieved this through
a different means of calculation that did not involve logirithms.  The first of these
we have already seem with Bermudo's third method of fretting, which approximates equal temperament
extremely closely yet using the standard geometrical string divisions that were common in many
other lute sources at the time.  Additional sources on
fretting in equal semitones come from Vicenzo Gallilei and Marin Mersenne, as well as
numerous other anecdotal sources that Mark Lindley has collected in which contemporary
musicians refer to the lute's ability to tune equally.

One of the simplest ways in which a lute player could achieve
semitones was to divide the octave into a series of Pythagorean minor semitones, at a ratio of
18:17.  Both Mersenne and Gallilei, as well as numerous other sources, discuss this method.  The
idea originates with the problem of dividing the Pythagorean 9:8 wholetone into 2 equal parts,
which I discussed in the previous chapter.  A series of minor semitones produced fairly
acceptable results, but as the frets progressed further down the fingerboard, the distances
became increasingly smaller.  By the time that a player had reached the seventh fret, the distance
was two milimeters shorter than true equal temperament and therefore slightly flat.  At the
twelfth fret, the different had increased to 2.5 milimeters.

Despite the descrease in distances, a series of equal minor semitones at a ratio of 18:17
provided a good usable temperament because the problems associated with it were largely unnoticed.
Most musicians at this time were using some form of temperament that flattened fifths, and at the
seventh fret, the fifth is already slightly flattened by 2 milimeters, using the example of a
lute with a 70 centimeter mensur.  Furthermore, the tension created from stopping a string
at a given fret, especially if the fret itself is quite thick or is doubled as is with frets
on the viola da gamba, can raise the pith slightly at the higher frets. \autocite[21]{ML:1}  This
is due to one of the qualities of the lute in which changes in pressue or finger position have a
more dramatic effect at high positions.  The result of flatter frets in higher
positions would mitigate this slight change in pitch.

Another method of determining equal fret positions used a device called a mesolab, which was
an instrument of Greek origin that was used to find two mean proporitionals between two
given lines.  In 1558, Zarlino published a fretting scheme for lute that relied on such a device.
\autocite[26]{ML:1}  There is also a picture of one in the \textit{Discours [...]}, published in
1556, which was mentioned earlier.  However, use of the mesolab did not appear in any practical
fretting guides and seems to be relegated to music theory sources where equal temperement
was a kind of puzzle to be solved and not really taken seriously in a musical context.

By the seventeenth century, mathematics had advanced enough to employ decimal numbers and
logarithms to express musical ratios.  Johannes Faulhaber was the first to use logarithms for
a fretting scheme in his 1630 publication. \autocite[21]{ML:1}  In order for it to work, the
string had to be divided into 20,000 parts.  This idea later found its way into an apendix
to a translation of Rene Descartes' \textit{Musicae compendium}.  Mark Lindley has concluded
that its translator is William Brouncker, who also wrote the appendix.  The appendix contained
several fretting schemes for lute, including our modern-day one using the $ \sqrt[12]{2} $ method,
as well as some others of his own devising.

Despite the accuracy of logarithmic caluculations in placing frets at equal temperament, the
method was largely ignored except in a few treatieses.  While many authors spoke of the lute's
abilitly to play with equal semitones, the idea of an ``equal temperament'' was something less
certain.  From the available evidence, systems approximating equal temperment and utilizing
the idea of equal semitones certainly existed during this period, but they still recognized
the issue of somehow attempting to reconcile the idea of unequal semitones found in the
temperaments of all the other instruments.  The central crux of the lute player's struggle
was how to navigate these two poles.

\section{Summary}
After this lengthy description of the available sources on fretting from the sixteenth century
and seventeenth centures,
we can see some them agree on the placement of certain frets (see table ~\ref{table:comparison}).
The first, fifth and seventh are  almost all uniformly Pythagorean in nature.  The choice of pure
intervals for the fifth and fourth
is obvious because that enabled players to tune the open strings to one another by using the fifth
fret of the adjacent strings as a reference.  This is corraborated by every source at this time
that contained instructions for tuning the lute's open strings.

The use of a Pythagroean wholetone for the second fret seems like a good choice at first glance,
since the second fret would be used in most scalar passages as the wholetone above the open
strings.  However, when used in chords, the second fret often holds the third of the chord.
In meantone tempreraments, this would mean that the second fret would need to be lower in
pitch or moved closer to the nut in order to accomdate either a sixth or quarter comma meantone
temperament.  Furthermore, the use of pure fourths and fifths in  lute fretting systems,
which would result in pure fourths between open strings, discounts the use of any meantone
temperament because they rely on fifths that are much flatter than pure.

Even with the evidence thus far that lute tunings in the sixteenth century contradicted the meantone
temperaments of keyboard instruments at the time, lutenists were still
experimenting with meantone intervals for the chromatic frets of their instruments.  This
includes frets one, three, four and six.  In the sources examined thus far, there is unanimous
use of the diatonic sixth-comma semitone for the first fret.  This would mean that for instruments
tuned in either G or A, their first frets would have to be A-flat of G-flat respectively.

Where the sources show the greatest amount of variety are the chromatic frets other than the
first.  While there seems to be some sort of agreement that the first fret was a diatonic
semitone, there is debate about the quality of the third and fourth.  Each source has its own
technique for placing the fourth fret.  Dowland and Gerle seem to favor chromatic frets than
closely approximate sixth-comma meantone intervals, while Ganassi and Bermudo arrive at the same
placement for their third fret, but neither of them come close to any interval in the meantone
scheme of temperament.

In the next chapter, we shall examine some of these fretting solutions in a musical context, using
exmaples from the period.  In some cases, the fretting solutions do not work and force the player
to chose his or her own fret placement.  With that in mind, we will also examine the ways in which
modern lute players set their frets and how that compares to the original systems outlined here.
