\chapter{Solutions for Modern Lutenists}

Given the evidence presented from historical sources and contemporary sources such
as Mark Lindley's book on historical temperaments for fretted instruments, we can all
agree that playing in some kind of temperament that uses or approximates equal semitones
is at least no historically ``wrong.''  However, we cannot use that statement to make
a blanket policy that all lutes or any other kind of fretting instrument was tunned with
equal semitones.  Given that ensembles and other instruments from this period did not
use equal semitones, we would have to examine the instances of lutes in ensembles
on a case-by-case basis.

Given the limitations of fretted instruments, it is still possible to
play in quarter-comma or other meantone temperaments on the lute or theorbo.  We just
have to acknowledge that certain steps were taken in order to achieve the desired result.
