\chapter{Summary of Solutions}

Lute players today who want to perform music from the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries must address the issue of using historically appropriate temperaments on
their instruments. Because of the nature of fretted instruments, using temperaments
with unequal semitones requires a different approach than is used with keyboards or
other instruments. In some ways, lutes have greater flexibility with temperaments than
keyboards do, but this flexibility results in a multitude of choices and options that
players must consider when fretting their instruments. The choices can also reflect
personal opinions rather than historical accuracy.

To realize temperaments with unequal semitones on the lute, there are two basic approaches, both of
which are supported by historical evidence. The first is the ``fixed semitone'' method where each
fret is one type of semitone: chromatic, diatonic, equal or something unique. The second approach
treats the lute as an enharmonic instrument, similar to harpsichords with split keys. In this
method, two kinds of semitones, such as the diatonic and chromatic, are available at certain
locations on the fretboard using split or slanted frets, or with the aid of tastini. The choice is
entirely at the discretion of the player, and either technique can work regardless of the context in
which it is used.

In this concluding chapter, I will elaborate on the flexibility of these approaches and describe
scenarios in which either can be employed successfully.  I will also discuss methods for adjusting
frets in order to perform with keyboards and other instruments in ensembles. The nature of lute
temperaments as this time indicates that they were not universally applied in the same way as other
instruments. While the modern musical world relies on established standards of pitch as well as
temperament, such standards did not exist at this time in musical history. Pitch could vary from
city to city, and even from ensemble to ensemble. This same variation applied to temperaments as
well, not only between different ensembles, but between different instruments in the same ensemble.
This is perhaps why the lute held such an important place because it could conform to the different
requirements of temperament more easily than keyboards; however, this is not to say that specialized
lute temperaments were only for ensemble music.

\section{Frets with fixed semitones}

As lute players, we have the option to ``fix it and forget it'' or in other words, set
our frets to a certain position and leave them. This requires a customized kind of
fretting system in which we accept the limitations of the temperament and either set
our frets in a way that makes the entire fretboard available to us or pick and choose
which semitones we want to play on which fret. The historical sources presented in
chapter two showed a predominant use of these kinds of customized temperaments
consisting of different kinds of semitones used throughout the octave. They are neither
completely one kind of meantone, such as quarter-comma or sixth-comma, nor are they
consistently Pythagorean or equal in nature.

Evidence clearly indicates that fretting systems approximating equal temperament had
their place and purpose on the lute, while most other instruments preferred to use a
non-equal temperament.  So why is it that fretted instruments held this exception? The
reason seems to be that it was simply easier for a lutenist to divide the octave into
twelve approximately equal semitones than it was for a keyboardist. A keyboardist would
temper intervals aurally, counting beats between notes, while a lute player could
visualize the fret distances and create quasi-equal semitones by making a good
visual approximation between two existing frets and placing the fret somewhere in the
middle.

The visual method of approximating equal semitones could also take an iterative approach as well,
wherein the fret is adjusted several times while playing to find the position at which the semitones
sound the best. Whether by visual placement or trial and error, the semitones that resulted from
such methods were not true Equal Temperament, as today's modern standard, but where an ``equal-ish''
temperament. These kinds of customized temperaments would be irregular in nature, with semitones of
varying size throughout the octave.  Depending on the semitone, however, they would be much closer
to modern-day equal temperament than some of the existing meantone temperaments of the time.

The use of temperaments that could approximate equal semitones was a distinguishing
feature of the lute and would have appealed to amateurs. The treatises from which we
take our fretting instructions were often written for amateur musicians and intended
for their education. A simple fretting solution that yields a quasi-equal temperament
would simplify matters for someone who was still learning how to play the instrument.
As players became more experienced, they could start moving frets around to their
liking, creating a temperament that could selectively use different size
semitones. Bermudo describes this when he refers to musicians who move their
frets according to their ears, but he instead wants to make the vihuela ``more
prefect'' with equal semitones for inexperienced players.\autocite[78]{DE:1}

Equal-ish temperaments and other customized schemes would also lend themselves to solo
lute music and repertoire for small ensembles such as the lute and voice. For example,
the Dowland song \textit{Come heavy sleep} in the previous chapter would benefit
from a temperament with fifths not quite as flat.  In such a temperament, 
the D$\sharp$ and F$\sharp$ would not sound quite as strident as
they would if were in quarter-comma meantone. Some of the custom fretting solutions
discussed in the previous chapter could work in this regard, with fifths wider than
quarter-comma, although yet another solution is to use a different type of
meantone.

Different varieties of meantone were presented in chapter one, and in chapter two we saw
that many of the historical fretting sources preferred sixth-comma meantone for certain
frets.   Sixth-comma figured quite prominently in these for the first, third, and sixth
frets (see table~\ref{table:comparison}). A similar temperament was also typical for
other fretted instruments such as cittern, which was commonly tuned using a
temperament somewhere between quarter-comma meantone and equal temperament.
\autocite[12]{PF:1}  Sixth-comma meantone is essentially the midway point between
quarter-comma meantone and equal temperament, because its thirds are tuned slightly
wider than pure, but not as wide as in equal temperament. Other meantone
temperaments whose thirds were wider than pure, and therefore similar to a sixth-comma
and other meantone varieties, work well in early sixteenth-century repertoire such as
the music of vihuela composers Alonzo Mudarra and Luis Milan.\autocite[56]{WH:1}
Lastly, we can refer to Praetorius, in his \textit{Syntagma Musicum}, describing
frets with 4$ \frac{1}{2} $ commas.\autocite[68]{MP:1} Although he is describing a
semitone divided equally, it is still sixth-comma in nature because the wholetone has 9
parts, indicating that the frets were initially set in that kind of temperament.

Sixth-comma meantone is an excellent choice for fretted instruments because it does not restrict the
instrument as much as quarter-comma does, and generally does not require many modifications to make
it successful. At the same time, it makes a good compromise between equal semitones and the pure
thirds of quarter-comma meantone, allowing the lute to play all the semitones in the octave without
much difficulty. Irregular temperaments, such as Vallotti and Werkmeister, that share many of the
characteristics of sixth-comma meantone were used well into the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries. These temperaments lend themselves quite well to the lute and I can speak both personally
and anecdotally that many lutenists prefer to use either a regular sixth-comma meantone or its
irregular varieties as their default temperament for most music.

Custom fretting solutions and temperaments such as sixth-comma meantone are ideal
for the lute in either solo music or small ensembles.  For example, in lute song
repertoire and in ensembles with additional fretted instruments, or instruments that do not
have a fixed semitone size, such as a violin or wind instrument, customized temperaments
do not present a problem because the instruments can conform to the temperament of
the lute or other fretted instruments. Fixed-fret solutions, however, become
problematic when using keyboards that are not tuned in sixth-comma, or if the members
of the ensemble prefer quarter-comma meantone over other temperaments.

It is possible to play a lute in quarter-comma meantone using a fixed system with one semitone per
fret; however, players must restrict the placement of certain semitones
on the fretboard.  They should choose the semitones needed for a particular
piece, and place them in their designated location on the fretboard.  For a theorbo
in A, for example, we can set our frets using the standard quarter-comma fretting
pattern for lute described in chapter three (see figure~\ref{fig:quarter-diatonic-complete-a}
in the appendix for the complete fretting).  In this pattern, C$\sharp$ and F$\sharp$
are found on the fourth fret, and if we slant our sixth fret as described in
figure~\ref{theorbo-slanted-sixth}, we would also have the G$\sharp$ as well. Depending
on the piece of music, that might be sufficient for our needs.

If the needed semitones vary from piece to piece, or between sections of a larger work
such as an opera, players could change the position of the frets if they have enough
time when not playing. Additional solutions could involve slanting
other frets, either before or during performance, or choosing to tie a double fret so
that it can be split and one side moved higher or lower than the other. Using varied
pressure with the left-hand to alter the pitch is another possibility, but this
has a limited effect as it will also reduce the resonance of the stopped note, muffling
it slightly. Beyond these types of surface fixes, we must turn to extended methods if
we want to have more than one kind of semitone at a fret.

\section{Enharmonic fretting}

If we truly need two different kinds of semitones available to us, and a fixed-fret
approach does not work, then we must turn to using either tastini or additional frets
tied to the fingerboard.  This offers the best possible solution and treats the lute as
an enharmonic instrument, allowing both chromatic and diatonic semitones to be
played. The drawback is that it increases the complexity of the instrument substantially,
and requires added technical skills on the part of the player. Players who work in
ensembles that use temperaments such as quarter-comma will opt for enharmonic fretting
if they wish to have a complete working solution. However, anyone is free to use an
enharmonic fretting in solo literature as well.

Generally speaking, one tastino will make a chromatic semitone for a single course, while the
remaining courses are diatonic.  A common example of this are the tastini found between the nut and
first fret, as we saw in figure~\ref{fig:theorbo-tastini}. Whether stopping a course using a fret or
tastino, the best resonance is created on the instrument when the finger of the left-hand stops the
course just behind the fret or tastino, being as close to it as possible without going past it.
Usually, this process results in one kind of semitone per course so that if a tastino was used at
one course, that course would contain a chromatic semitone, while the others were diatonic.
However, some players cultivate the skill of playing both the diatonic and chromatic semitones on a
course where a tastino is used. In that case, the diatonic semitone is played with the finger placed
between the tastino and main fret, and the chromatic with the finger placed just behind the
tastino.  The skill involved is to correctly navigate the space between the fret and tastino, and to
have enough space between the two, and a small enough finger, to stop the course correctly and
achieve a good sound.

Tastini can be affixed to the fretboard in various ways. Ivory was the material of choice during
this time, but since it is illegal today, a toothpick and a piece of double-sided tape  will work
just just as well.  The main disadvantage of tastini, once a player is accustomed to using them, is
that they may slip or break.  More permanent solutions are possible, such as using glue and a more
durable wood, but this forces the instrument into a particular temperament.  If professional needs
dictate tuning in a variety of temperaments, permanent tastini may not be the ideal solution, in
which case the ``tape and toothpick'' approach will be the only option.

For players who wish to extend a lute's capabilities even further, as well as avoiding
some of the problems associated with tastini, we can have chromatic and diatonic
semitones available on all courses. Recalling Bermudo's example of an additional
\textit{mi} fret in figure~\ref{fig:bermudo-1-mifa}, if an extra fret spans the entire
width of the fretboard, we have the option of playing either semitone on every course.
Bermudo seems to suggest that players at the time were comfortable doing this with their left
hand.  The scale of the instrument would have a direct effect on the the difficulty of
such a technique.  For example, on smaller lutes with a mensur of 60 centimeters or
less, the distance between a diatonic and chromatic semitone in quarter-comma meantone
at the first fret--where the distances are greatest--is just over a centimeter.
Depending on the size of one's fingers, it might be challenging to finger the diatonic
semitone in this space.  On instruments with a longer mensur length, such as the
theorbo where distances of 85 centimeters or larger are not uncommon, this distance
increases to almost two centimeters.

Instruments with longer mensur lengths have a greater distance between their semitones and therefore
could hold a small advantage in situations where different semitones are required. The larger
distance would make it easier for an experienced player to choose the diatonic semitone over the
chromatic one, and vice-versa. The thickness of the fret would also be a factor because the
chromatic fret would need to be slightly larger in diameter than the diatonic one. If this were not
the case, and the chromatic fret were smaller in diameter, then the thicker diatonic fret would
vibrate against the course if it was stopped using the chromatic fret.  While a larger diameter
chromatic fret would prevent this, it would also decrease the available fretboard space between
pitches, making larger instruments with a longer mesur, such as the theorbo, an ideal choice for
enharmonic fretting solutions.  Ensemble situations are often the main cause for temperament
problems with fretted instruments.  Theorbos and archlutes, which also have longer mensur lengths,
can enjoy preferred status not only because of their increased volume due to their body size and
string length, but also because they may navigate issues of semitone size better than some of their
smaller counterparts.

\section{Playing with Ensembles}

When performing with large ensembles or groups with keyboards and other fretting instruments,
players must take special care to ensure that each musician's tuning and temperament agrees with
everyone else. Typically, this means that everyone agrees on what kind of temperament the ensemble
will use and everyone will tune their instruments, and place their frets accordingly.  For example,
let us suppose that the temperament of choice for the ensemble in quarter-comma meantone.  Prior to
rehearsal, we would choose either a fixed-fret or enharmonic strategy, and use measurements  or an
electronic tuner to place our frets in the correct positions.  At rehearsal time, we would then tune
our instrument to the appropriate pitch level, and hope for the best!  However, in an actual
rehearsal situation, things usually do not work this way.

When performing with keyboard instruments, the reality is you are at the mercy of the keyboard
tuner.  I have been fortunate enough to have worked with many excellent tuners that can perfectly
tune an instrument in any temperament; however, keyboards sometimes are not tuned regularly and
changes in the conditions of the room in which the instrument is kept can have drastic effects
on the pitch and temperament of the instrument.  No matter if a keyboard was tunned correctly to
quarter-comma meantone, a day or two later, with any change in the weather or climate conditions
in the building in which it is kept, means that the instrument will be in something slightly different
than quarter-comma and we as lute players must be able to adapt.

The fragile nature of keyboard tuning means that lutenists must be able to tune their instruments
to the keyboard, and more importantly, adapt to a temperament that may not necessarily be found
in a chart of fret measurements or on the dial of an electronic tuner.  If we arrive at a rehearsal,
even if our instrument is correctly tuned to quarter-comma meantone, if the keyboard is not, then
we must adjust our frets to match the tuning of the keyboard, along with the rest of the ensemble.
In order to do this, it is important to remember the general concepts of temperaments on a lute,
rather than focus on technical specifics, such as determining the exact temperament of the 
keyboard.  Finding a name for the keyboard's temperament is not as important as being able to
play in tune with it.

When faced with a keyboard in an unknown or unspecified temperament, the first thing to do is
ascertain the overall pitch level of the instrument.  Is its A tuned to 415 Hz, to 440 Hz, or
somewhere in the middle?  You will need to match the pitch level of your instrument to the
keyboard.  Next, examine the more common semitones such as F$\sharp$, C$\sharp$, and B$\flat$, then
compare them to those found on your instrument or to an electronic tuner.  Do they match your
pitches, or the quarter-comma semitones as indicated on the electronic tuner?  If they do not, then
you will need to adjust your frets accordingly.  You will also need to determine the qualities of
the remaining semitones.  Does the keyboard have an E$\flat$ or a D$\sharp$, or a G$\sharp$ instead
of an A$\flat$, and where is its wolf fifth?  Finally, and most importantly, are the semitones
consistent across all the octaves of the instrument?  This can help you and the other members of the
continuo section determine who is best equipped to play specific accidentals in the music.

Once you have gained an understanding of the keyboard's temperament, you can begin to adjust your
frets to match it.  If the keyboard's tuning no longer matches quarter-comma, then you must discard
all of the fret placements you calculated earlier; however, this is not as drastic as it may seem.
Even if the keyboard has morphed into some unknown temperament, whether by climate change or a
tuning error, adjusting a few frets on your instrument will probably be enough to correct the
situation.  Assuming you are using a theorbo, tune your open A courses to the keyboard.  Since the
first fret is always a diatonic semitone, adjust the first fret of the theorbo to match the B$\flat$
of the keyboard.  Because this will affect the tuning of the seventh and eighth courses, you will
need to make additional corrections.  If your eighth course is on the long neck of the instrument,
you can simply tune the course to either F or F$\sharp$ to match the keyboard.  If your seventh and
eighth courses are on the fingerboard, then you can either slant the fret at an angle or adjust your
tastini to produce a G$\sharp$ and F$\sharp$ that matches the keyboard instrument.  If you are short
on time, or your tastini do not  cooperate, you can elect to use an A$\flat$ for the seventh course
and adjust your sixth fret so that you have the G$\sharp$ available on the fifth course (see
figure~\ref{theorbo-slanted-sixth}).  You can make similar adjustments to the fourth fret to produce
an F$\sharp$ or you may tune your eighth course to F$\sharp$, even if it is on the fretboard.  You
will have to remember, however, that the F$\natural$ is no longer available.  This is perhaps why
some seventeenth-century theorbists used a F$\sharp$ for their lowest course, instead of the low
octave G, so that they could have both the F$\natural$ and the F$\sharp$ available as open courses.

After setting your first fret and determining how you will fret chromatic semitones of the lower
courses on the fingerboard, only a few other frets remain to check and adjust, if necessary.  The
second fret will be chromatic because it contains the F$\sharp$ and C$\sharp$; we will need to
ensure that these match the keyboard as well. Finally, check all the open strings of your instrument
and tune them to the keyboard. With your frets properly adjusted, if the keyboard is in a consistent
temperament, then your instrument should match the keyboard.

In an ideal world, they keyboard is kept in the proper conditions and tuned regularly so that its
temperament is consistent and you will not have to make any drastic adjustments to your frets other
than tuning your instrument's overall pitch level to the keyboard. Even if this is the case, there
will still be certain pitches, chords, and voicings that simply sound better on one instrument and
not the other.  In this scenario, one approach for a continuo section to use is to divide the
responsibilities of each player so that problematic figures go to the instrument with the best
tuning for that particular figure.  A lutenist can also change the voicing of a chord so that
offending notes are not placed in highest tessitura of the chord, where they are easily heard.
Instead, problematic notes may be voiced in the lower registers where they are obscured from the
listener.

In cases where your instrument's chromatic notes or accidentals do not agree with another
instrument's, no matter how many corrective steps are taken, you can always omit them. Andreas
Werkmeister, whose irregular temperaments are an excellent choice in seventeenth-century repertoire,
published a treatise on accompaniment which is partially translated by F. T. Arnold:
\begin{blocks}
It is also not advisable that one should always just blindly play, together with the vocalists
and instrumentalists, the dissonances which are indicated in in the Thorough-Bass, and double
them
\autocite[210]{FTA:1}
\end{blocks}
Often, these dissonances are semitones that may be either diatonic or chromatic in nature;
therefore, if there is any disagreement between you and the other instruments, it is best solved by
omitting the offending note.  Aesthetically, doubling the dissonance could undermine their effect,
which why Werkmeister and other composers during this time avoided doing so.  \autocite[45]{RJ:1}
This technique can also be extended to other notes which may not match among different instruments,
such as the thirds of chords.  In that case, the lute player or keyboardist can elect to play an
open fifth, which another instrument or the soloists completes the harmony with the third.  In this
way, disagreements of temperament are solved by avoiding the confrontation altogether.

Above all else, the most important aspect of utilizing temperaments when performing with ensembles
is that your instrument should sound its best. Even with all the instruments of an ensemble tuned
precisely to quarter-comma meantone, there still may be disagreements in pitch simply due to the
proclivities of each instrument. This is why all our practical examples and the historical evidence
support a great amount of flexibility in applying tuning and accompaniment techniques. There is no
doubt that musicians at this time employed unequal temperaments, but they were also very aware of
difficulties that these temperaments could create, which is why we must acknowledge that while they
too grappled with them, they were also able to use them to create exquisite and beautiful music.

\section{Conclusion}

Regardless of the instrument's size, tuning, or repertoire, lute players have many different options
when it comes to choosing a temperament.  One can review all the historical evidence, and propose as
many different fretting solutions as one is able, but the principle will always remain the same: the
choice of fretting will always rest with the player. The sources are quite clear that there were a
multitude of different options available and certain options aroused heated arguments between
musicians. The same is true today as well. One can find very spirited discussions of tuning and
fretting in various online forums dedicated to topics on tuning and lute playing. Similar arguments
can be found in print too, and that will never change. \autocite{DD:4}

What is certain is that temperaments with unequal semitones were an aesthetic choice for musicians
during this time.  While the idea that a Pythagorean wholetone, which could not be divided equally,
provided a theoretical argument against the use of equal temperament, when mathematically equal
divisions of the semitone appeared  later in the seventeenth century, with the advent of complex
algorithmic functions,  musicians still favored their unequal semitones.  Methods for approximating
equal temperament were widely known as early as the fifteenth century, yet the resistance to
adopting them was a clear indication that they were considered inferior to other temperaments that
created purer thirds at the expense of limiting key choices.

Another fundamental aspect to unequal temperaments is the quality they give to different pitches and
keys.  In meantone temperaments, the difference between F$\sharp$ and B$\flat$ can be  distressing.
In today's modern ideals, these differences are not cultivated and are instead homogenized, making
all keys and accidentals equal.  However, in the sixteenth and seventeenth century, differences
between semitones created differences between keys and spawned perceptions of the ``characters of
the keys'' or idea that C major has a difference quality that is  fundamentally different than A
major, beyond the simple issue that one is higher or lower in pitch than the other.

Temperament was a concept that pervaded all music during this time, and we as authorities in this
music have to recognize its importance and imbue music with the qualities that temperaments give to
it.  This requires careful consideration and a deep understanding of the  issues at work.  As lute
players, we have additional obligations because we have the option of moderating some of these
aesthetic goals in favor of practical solutions.  It seems that lutes and fretted instruments were
granted a kind of immunity and were allowed to tune equally; however, this does not absolve us from
trying to meet these goals in the first place.

Modern conveniences, such as electronic tuners, can make it seem easy to choose one temperament over
another, and then move between them; however, our colleagues in the past had no such tools and
relied on the their ears.  This required a flexible approach from lute players who needed to match
with different kinds of ensembles.  The treaties bear this out, with multiple methods for setting
frets and iterative techniques that instruct the player to try different positions and decide on
placements that sound the best.  Even these treatises  confute the idea of an exact placement scheme
which they seem to claim in the first place. For example, every source instruct players to place the
fifth fret at a pure ratio, making it an untempered perfect fourth.  Because players use the fifth
fret to tune the open strings, such an interval would create havoc when tuning all the courses. The
major third between the fourth and third courses would be intolerably wide!

Setting temperaments on the lute requires diligence and a great amount of experimentation to yield
an effective results.  While we are allowed to use a kind of equal temperament, it is never the
preferred solution.  As lute playing continues to evolve through the 21\textsuperscript{st} century,
we will continue to rehash these arguments and hopefully reach the same conclusions. The lute can
and did play in a variety of temperaments, both in solo and in ensemble contexts, but the efficacy
of its performance shall always rest with the skill of the player. No one would ever question the
choice of temperament in performance unless it distracted the listener from the quality of the
music.  Therefore, it should make no difference what temperament we use, as long as it best serves
the music, giving it the warmth and brilliance it justly deserves.
