Pad out the conclusion:

 * more  original material
 * your own thoughts and suggestions.
 * what your conclusions are, practical and  philosophical
 * your own advice to a lutenist about technical and aesthetic issues
 * paragraph at the end or beginning about the aesthetic ideals of unequal temperaments:

    - affect and expression: 
    - "arousing and stilling the passions" with dissonances and consonances
    - intervallic dissonance (e.g. F-sharp to B-flat that hurt more in 1/4 comma!)
    - the role temperaments played in increasing expressivity

 * playing together with a keyboard instrument in 1/4-comma meantone
    - how do you adjust the frets?

 * "divide and conquer" your accompaniment in a mixed continuo group, 
    - ommision of notes
    - advice in period sources to play open octaves and fifths to avoid problematic thirds and leading tones
    - rearranging voicings to exclude potentially offensive notes
