Today's standard of tuning is equal temperament and just about every instrument
that anyone purchases is usually built with that temperament in mind.  This has
been the case for most of the twentieth century, but when performing music from
earlier periods in Western music literature, the equal temperament standard does
not apply.  Although it was known to musicians at time, equal temperament was
not favored during the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries.  Instead,
meantone temperament was the perferred choice for instruments; however, it was
not standardized in the way that equal temperament is today.  Many kinds of
meantone temperaments existed during this period, and variants depended on the
date, geographical location and even the instrument.  These continued into the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, while newer, non-meantone temperaments
were invented.  The majority of these applied to keyboard instruments because of
the fixed nature of their pitches, but the same notion applied to all
instruments that equal temperament was not used.

Fretted instruments, such as lutes and theorbos, could set their frets in a
variety of different temperaments, but when performing in ensembles, they
generally had to follow the same meantone standard.  However, the execution of a
meantone temperament on a lute differed from that performed on other
instruments. Keyboard instruments, for example, had their own procedures for
producing different versions.  Lutes and similar fretted instruments could
produce these as well, but the process and the limitations a particular
temperament imposed could differ. The implications for a lute player at this
time were that the player would need to alter his or her technique, and in some
cases, the instrument itself, in order to accommodate a particular temperament.
This raises the question of how performers at that time dealt with the issue.
More importantly, it should give today's performers pause when determining what
temperament to use.  Just as we cannot apply an all-encompassing modern
temperament to older music, neither can we apply an all-encompassing
historically-informed one either.

The principal difference between today's equal temperament and the majority of
those found at the turn of the seventeenth century is that the latter had
semitones of non-uniform or varied size.  This could either be regular, where
the distance between the semitones within an octave followed a predictable
pattern, or it could be irregular with the distance varying greatly from one to
the next. When tuning a keyboard instrument where each string or pipe can be
pitched independently of the others, this presents no problem.  Bowed
instruments without frets may alter their pitches with the placement of the
left-hand fingers.  Wind instruments have fingerings and the performer's
embouchure to provide small adjustments in pitch to match any kind of
temperament.

Because fretted instruments place their frets so that each intersects all of the
strings on the instrument, the inherent problem with attempting to use semitones of
varying size is that when you set the size of a semitone for one string of the
instrument, you have set the same sized semitone for all the other notes on the
adjacent strings. This creates unavoidable problems if the temperament you are trying
to emulate requires a small semitone on one string but a larger one
on the string next to it. The result is that as you progress down the fingerboard and
set the size of each of your semitones, whether they are equidistant or not, you must
choose what sized semitone benefits the majority of the pitches on that fret. If the
majority of the pitches on a fret are best suited to a small semitone, then you must
have a semitone of the same small size for all of those pitches. Alternatively, if the
majority of the pitches require a large semitone, then all the pitches get the same
sized, larger semitone.  The inherent problem is that there is usually one pitch on the
fret that does not fit and needs to have a semitone of a different size than
all the others.

Lute players have dealt with these problems of varied semitone size for centuries, and
while there is no perfect solution, there are many combinations of
possible solutions that produce good results. What follows is a detailed examination
of these solutions.  Before we get to these, however, we need a a brief
explanation of the history of tuning and temperament. Chapter One provides both
context and a working technical knowledge of temperament. The second chapter
examines historical fretting systems published during the sixteenth and early
seventeenth centuries. Here we will see how lute players at the time dealt with
temperament and the shortcomings of their solutions. Chapter Three moves beyond
historical fretting systems and attempts to a provide unified fretting system for use
in performance by combining historical techniques with modern practices.  We will see
how historical fretting systems must be modified in order to be successful and what
other techniques may be used to achieve a workable system. The last chapter provides a
conclusion to our predicament and summarizes the many different ways lute players
may navigate temperaments in modern day performance.
