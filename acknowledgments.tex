\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Acknowledgments}

First and foremost, my thanks to Nigel North for guiding me through the research process and helping me fully understand
this topic. To my committee members, I thank them for their time and attention to the details of my writing and helping
me to clarify what is I am trying to say. I would also like to thank David Dolata, who read an early draft of this paper
and provided me with many insightful comments and suggestions. I am indebted to my father, George Wead, for many things,
but his translations of the Latin fretting sources I encountered were especially helpful.  Lastly, a big word of thanks
to Anie, for seeing me through this to the very end.
